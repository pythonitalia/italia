# Italia: A Celebration of Python Italia 🇮🇹

Welcome to **Italia**, a fun and whimsical package born out of the spirit of PyCon
Italia 2024. This package celebrates the Python Italia association and aims to bring a
touch of Italian charm to your Python experience.

## 🎉 Introduction

The idea for this package started with a t-shirt printed for PyCon Italia 2024,
featuring the line `from italia import 🤌`. Unfortunately, due to the current
limitations in Python, this import isn't possible — yet. But that didn't stop us from
creating something special!

**Italia** is an Easter egg package that celebrates the vibrant community of Python
Italia. It's designed to amuse, surprise, and inspire future Pythonistas by sharing a
bit of the magic of PyCon Italia with the community.

## Disclamer!

To make `from italia import 🤌` you need to compile and install CPython from:
