    Of all the things necessary for an association, opening a bank account might seem
    the simplest, right? WRONG!

    Valentino Volonghi, Simone Zinanni, and I, Marco Beri, had the honor on March 23,
    2007, of being chosen as administrators of Python Italia APS. The main purpose of
    Python Italia is to organize PyCon Uno.

    What seemed an honor soon became a burden. Organizing a conference on Python,
    still relatively unknown in Italy, required more than a few emails and phone calls.
    From February 23 to May 18, we wrote 1,683 emails. No, 1,684. No, 1,685. You get the
    idea?

    These emails covered hotels, trains, lunches, blogs, projectors, logos, transfers,
    speakers, sponsors, fees, schedules, bank accounts, and more. You might think,
    "Opening a bank account? It's 2007, how hard can it be?". The answer is: if you are
    an APS, it takes a lot of time and patience.

    We found an online bank that seemed ideal. After gathering IDs, tax codes, and
    shoe sizes, the three of us traveled to Milan to sign a couple of kilos of forms.
    Valentino had a cast on his wrist, making each signature a struggle, while Simone
    and I dealt with growing frustration.

    Days passed, and the account didn't open. Sponsors and participants were eager to
    send us money, but we couldn't receive it! After fifteen days, our promoter told us
    that the bank was hesitant because we weren't a profit-making entity.

    We scrambled for alternatives and finally succeeded with a branch of BCC bank.
    Thanks to a fortunate connection, we opened the account in two days, falling into
    the privileged category of parishes!

    But it's only fair: after all, Python is a faith... :-)
